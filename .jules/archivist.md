## 2025-12-14 - Add Testing Section to README
**Issue:** The `README.md` file did not contain any instructions on how to run the project's test suite.
**Learning:** A lack of clear testing instructions increases onboarding friction and makes it harder for developers to contribute with confidence. The project has a custom test runner, so the standard `pytest` command would not work.
**Action:** Added a "Testing" section to `README.md` with the correct command to run the test suite and a brief explanation of what the tests cover.
