## YYYY-MM-DD - Initial Observability Assessment
**Finding:** The application uses a custom logging module that provides colored console output and optional file logging. However, the logs are unstructured strings, making them difficult to parse and query in a centralized logging system. Key operational events, such as WebSocket connections and disconnections, are not explicitly logged, which hinders the diagnosis of connectivity issues.
**Learning:** Unstructured logs make it challenging to create reliable alerts and dashboards for critical events. Without structured information like `user_id`, `request_id`, or `disconnect_reason`, it's nearly impossible to diagnose issues like disconnect storms or identify patterns in user-specific problems.
**Action:** Introduce structured logging to provide clear, machine-readable data for important events. The first step will be to add structured logs for WebSocket connection and disconnection events, including relevant context like `user_id` and `client_ip`. This will enable better monitoring and alerting for WebSocket-related issues.
